BE Enterprises - Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview
This project aims to develop an advanced Twitter data analysis pipeline for detecting spam and bot-generated content, as well as performing context-aware sentiment analysis. Leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP), NLP techniques, and pre-trained language models (like GPT-4), this project is designed to provide actionable insights for stakeholders through a real-time dashboard.

Objectives
Data Cleaning: Implement advanced techniques to filter out spam, bots, and irrelevant content.
Sentiment Analysis: Use contextual sentiment analysis to handle ambiguous or context-dependent language (e.g., sarcasm, irony).
Project Architecture
The project uses a mix of GCP services, BigQuery, MongoDB, and Python libraries to achieve robust data analysis and visualization. Below is an overview of the architecture:

Data Source: Kaggle, Twitter/X API.
Data Processing: GCP Linux VM, Python scripts, and NLP models.
Data Storage: Google BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage.
Visualization: Power BI and Google Data Studio.
Deployment: GitHub, with CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.
Privacy & Compliance: GDPR-compliant data handling.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account.
Python 3.8+ installed locally.
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for running notebooks.
Access to Power BI or Google Data Studio for visualizations.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Code kopieren
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BE-Enterprises-Twitter-Analysis.git
cd BE-Enterprises-Twitter-Analysis
Set up the virtual environment:

bash
Code kopieren
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure GCP credentials:

Create a service account key and download the .json file.
Set the environment variable:
bash
Code kopieren
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/key.json"
Data Pipeline
Step 1: Data Collection
Fetch data using data_pipeline/data_fetch.py.
Configure API keys for Twitter/X and Kaggle.
Step 2: Data Cleaning
Run data_pipeline/data_cleaning.py to filter out spam and bot-generated content.
Use NLP techniques in nlp_cleaning.py to remove irrelevant data.
Step 3: Contextual Sentiment Analysis
Fine-tune the GPT-4 model using sentiment_analysis/contextual_sentiment.py.
Detect sarcasm, irony, and nuanced sentiment using pre-trained transformers.
Step 4: Data Storage
Load cleaned data into BigQuery using cloud_setup/bigquery_schema.sql.
Optionally, store data in MongoDB or Google Firestore for flexibility.
Visualization Dashboard
Launch the Power BI dashboard using the powerbi_dashboard.pbit file.
Alternatively, deploy a real-time dashboard using Google Data Studio with the script in realtime_dashboard.py.
Testing & Continuous Integration
Unit Tests: Run tests in the tests/ folder.
bash
Code kopieren
pytest tests/
CI/CD: Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.
Privacy & Compliance
Data handling is designed to be GDPR compliant, ensuring anonymization of user data.
Ethical considerations include regular audits for model biases, especially regarding ambiguous language detection.
Future Enhancements
Expand to other social media platforms for sentiment analysis.
Integrate AutoML for improved model accuracy.
Implement real-time alerts using GCP's Pub/Sub for stakeholder notifications.
