**Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project OverviewT**
his project aims to develop an advanced Twitter data analysis pipeline for detecting spam and bot-generated content, as well as performing context-aware sentiment analysis. Leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP), NLP techniques, and pre-trained language models (like GPT-4), this project is designed to provide actionable insights for stakeholders through a real-time dashboard.

**Objectives**

Data Cleaning: Implement advanced techniques to filter out spam, bots, and irrelevant content.
Sentiment Analysis: Use contextual sentiment analysis to handle ambiguous or context-dependent language (e.g., sarcasm, irony).

**Project Architecture**
The project uses a mix of GCP services, GCP storage, and Python libraries to achieve robust data analysis and visualization, more info. about directory structure: see architecture diagram file in GitHub files.

**Below is an overview of the architecture:**
Data Source: Kaggle, Twitter/X API.
Data Processing: GCP Linux VM, Python scripts, and NLP models.
Data Storage: Google Cloud Storage.
Visualization: Power BI and Google Data Studio.
Deployment: GitHub, with CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.
Privacy & Compliance: GDPR-compliant data handling.


**Getting Started**

A. Prerequisites
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account: Configure GCP credentials.
Python 3.8+ installed.
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for running notebooks.
Access to Power BI or Google Data Studio for visualizations.
Set up the virtual environment: Linux installation to clone the repository and CI/CD push.

B. Data Pipeline
Step 1: Data Collection
Fetch data using data_pipeline/data_fetch.py and configure API keys for Kaggle.
Step 2: Data Cleaning
Run data_pipeline/data_cleaning.py to filter out spam and bot-generated content.
Use NLP techniques in nlp_cleaning.py to remove irrelevant data.
Step 3: Contextual Sentiment Analysis
Fine-tune the GPT-4 model using sentiment_analysis/contextual_sentiment.py.
Detect sarcasm, irony, and nuanced sentiment using pre-trained transformers.
Step 4: Data Storage
Load cleaned data into cloud_setup
Optionally, can store data in Google Firestore for flexibility.

C. Visualization Dashboard
Launch the Power BI dashboard using the powerbi_dashboard.pbit file.
Alternatively, deploy a real-time dashboard using Google Data Studio with the script in realtime_dashboard.py.
Testing & Continuous Integration
Unit Tests: Run tests in the tests/ folder.

D. bash
CI/CD: Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.

F. Privacy & Compliance
Data handling is designed to be GDPR compliant, ensuring anonymization of user data.
Ethical considerations include regular audits for model biases, especially regarding ambiguous language detection.

G. Future Work recommended
Integrate AutoML for improved model accuracy.
Implement real-time alerts using GCP's Pub/Sub for stakeholder notifications.
